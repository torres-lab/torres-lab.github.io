	<h2><a id="WaterRock_Interaction_1"></a>Water/Rock Interaction</h2>
<p>The interaction between water and rock near Earthâ€™s surface drives a suite of
dissolution/precipitation, acid/base, and reduction/oxidation reactions collectively
called chemical weathering. These reactions are a major source of dissolved elements to
natural waters and account for large transfers of carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur
between the rock reservoir and the ocean/atmosphere system. Linkages between chemical
weathering processes and environmental conditions give rise to multiple feedbacks and
forcings on the Earth system that remain to be completely understood.</p>
<h2><a id="Organic_carbon_transport_and_burial_9"></a>Organic carbon transport and burial</h2>
<p>Like weathering, the synthesis of organic matter and its subsequent transport, storage,
and degradation is key to the biogeochemical cycling of C, O, P, and S. However, organic
matter cycling obeys a completely different set of <em>rules</em> than weathering, adding
a richer set of dynamics to major biogeochemical cycles.</p>
<h2><a id="Approaches_14"></a>Approaches</h2>
<p>In order to study chemical weathering and organic carbon cycling across a range of spatial and temporal scales, we utilize some combination of laboratory experiments, field studies, and numerical modelling. Present research interests include:</p>
<ol>
<li>calibrating trace element and isotope proxies for weathering and organic carbon cycling</li>
<li>parameterizing weathering and organic carbon feedbacks for use in Earth system models</li>
<li>linking weathering and organic carbon cycling with erosion and sediment transport processes</li>
</ol>
