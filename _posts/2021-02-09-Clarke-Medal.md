# Torres receives F.W. Clarke Award

Our fearless leader has been announced as the 2021 winner of the F.W. Clarke Award. According to the news release from the Geochemical Society, "The Clarke Award recognizes an early-career scientist for a single outstanding contribution to geochemistry or cosmochemistry published either as a single paper or a series of papers on a single topic. Dr. Torres is recognized for his work on the geochemistry of the Earthâ€™s surface focused on interactions between the hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and the crust." All of us in the lab are excited by the possibility of expanding our research to include the oxidation of "medal" sulfides. More to come with the awarding of the medal at the 2021 Goldschmidt Conference in July. Congrats, Mark!
