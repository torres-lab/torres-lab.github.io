# AGU Fall Meeting 2020

The Torres Lab was well represented at the 2020 AGU Fall meeting, with an oral presentation by graduate student Yi Hou ("Autogenic signals in sedimentary organic carbon records"), a poster presentation by Will Larsen ("Revisiting Solute Dynamics in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory Using Young Water Fractions"), and a poster presentation by Mark ("Hydrochemical monitoring of rivers in the Bocas del Toro region of Panama: insights into impacts on coastal environments"). Thank you to all who were able to view the presentations and discuss our science with us. Fingers-crossed we'll be able to do so again *in-person* next year...
