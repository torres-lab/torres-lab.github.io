		The <strong>Torres Lab</strong> focuses on the biological, chemical, and 
		geologic processes that act to distribute elements across our planet’s 
		surface and interior. While these biogeochemical processes operate across 
		the entire periodic table, the Torres lab is particularly interested in the 
		set of elements and compounds that regulate Earth’s habitability. 
		For example, the Torres Lab is deeply focused on the cycling of water, 
		carbon, and oxygen across a range of surface environments.

		Please see the <a href="/Research">Research Page</a> for some broad descriptions of the Torres Lab's current 
		research interests. While we strive to work across disciplines, our primary <em>tools</em> 
		are geochemical in nature.
